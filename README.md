# Personal Website
## [Deployed site](https://www.benjamincampbell.com)

Simple vanilla website created as an initial project to implement recently acquired html/css/javascript knowledge and to gain experience with the nuts and bolts of creating and deploying a site to the web. I implemented a few projects from Traversy Media's 50 vanilla project udemy course, as well as the Colt Steele Web Dev bootcamp Udemy course.
