This is my simple vanilla website created as an initial project to implement recently acquired html/css/javascript info and to gain experience with the nuts and bolts of creating and deploying a site to the web. I implemented a few projects from Traversy Media's 50 vanilla project udemy course, as well as the Colt Steele Web Dev bootcamp Udemy course. 

## Things to stretch
    -Add projects page - move commercial to it, add special pages for assembly, battab, etc
    -video thumbnails - make previously activated vids revert to thumbs
    -sticky active menu
    -when menu active, click on other part of page makes menu inactive 

Next step to add to webhost
